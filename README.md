## API

The [Yelp GraphQL API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/graphql/guides/intro) is used as the API for this Application. We have provided the boilerplate of the API requests and backing data models to save you some time. To successfully make a request to the Yelp GraphQL API, please follow these steps:

1. Please go to https://www.yelp.com/signup and sign up for a developer account.
1. Once signed up, navigate to https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app.
1. Create a new app by filling out the required information.
1. Once your app is created, scroll down and join the `Developer Beta`. This allows you to use the GraphQL API.
1. Copy your API Key from your app page and paste it on `line 5` [yelp_repository.dart](app/lib/yelp_repository.dart) replacing the `<PUT YOUR API KEY HERE>` with your key.
1. Run the app and tap the `Fetch Restaurants` button. If you see a log like `Fetched x restaurants` you are all set!

## Technical Requirements

### State Management

Please restrict your usage of state or dependency injection to the following options:

1. [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider)
2. [Riverpod](https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod)
3. [bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc)
4. [get_it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it)/[get_it_mixins](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it_mixin)

We ask this because this challenge values consistency and efficiency over ingenuity.  Using commonly used libraries ensures that we can review your code in a timely manner and allows us to provide better feedback.

## Coding Values

At **Superformula** we strive to build applications that have

- Consistent architecture
- Extensible, clean code
- Solid testing
- Good security & performance best practices

### Clear, consistent architecture

Approach your submission as if it were a real world app. This includes Use any libraries that you would normally choose.

_Please note: we're interested in your code & the way you solve the problem, not how well you can use a particular library or feature._

### Easy to understand

Writing boring code that is easy to follow is essential at **Superformula**.

We're interested in your method and how you approach the problem just as much as we're interested in the end result.

### Solid testing approach

While the purpose of this challenge is not to guage whether you can achieve 100% test coverage, we do seek to evaluate whether you know how & what to test.

## Bonus Requirements

If you are feeling up to it and want to add some more functionality to the application try some of these bonus items

- Implement persistance storage for favorited restaurants
- Implement the *Bonus Detail Screen*
